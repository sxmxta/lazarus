# lazarus

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/sxmxta/lazarus/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sxmxta/lazarus/actions)

Originating from [setup-lazarus](https://github.com/gcarreno/setup-lazarus)
- Added Linux aarch64 architecture

Set up your GitHub Actions workflow with a specific version of Lazarus

## Inputs

### lazarus-version

**REQUIRED** Lazarus version.

**DEFAULT** stable.

Possible values:

* `stable` - Installs the latest stable version: 2.2.6
* `2.2.6`  - comes with `FPC v3.2.2`
* `2.2.4`  - comes with `FPC v3.2.2`
* `2.2.2`  - comes with `FPC v3.2.2`

### include-packages

**OPTIONAL** List of packages to install.

You can ask the action to fetch packages and install them after Lazarus is installed.

Format is a string with the packages separated by comma: "Package 1, Package 2, Package 3".

The list of packages can be searched at the [Lazarus IDE repository](https://packages.lazarus-ide.org).

### with-cache

**OPTIONAL** Use cached installer files.

**DEFAULT** true.

This is a boolean input and will use cache if set to `true`.

**NOTE**

> At this moment, there's an issue with the retrieved install executables for Windows.
> I'm trying to get to the bottom of why, but it's going to take some time.
> Caching is now off ny default for Windows until I can solve this issue!
